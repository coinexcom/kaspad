// SigCacheECDSA implements an ECDSA signature verification cache with a randomized
// entry eviction policy. Only valid signatures will be added to the cache. The
// benefits of SigCache are two fold. Firstly, usage of SigCache mitigates a DoS
// attack wherein an attack causes a victim's client to hang due to worst-case
// behavior triggered while processing attacker crafted invalid transactions. A
// detailed description of the mitigated DoS attack can be found here:
// https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/fixed-bitcoin-vulnerability-explanation-why-the-signature-cache-is-a-dos-protection/.
// Secondly, usage of the SigCache introduces a signature verification
// optimization which speeds up the validation of transactions within a block,
// if they've already been seen and verified within the mempool.
